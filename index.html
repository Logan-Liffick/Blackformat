          <li><p  class="pSlide-up">Do not make personal attacks, harass anyone, or be intentionally rude. When debating issues, stick to the facts. No ad hominem attacks.</p></li>
          <li><p  class="pSlide-up">Do not spam. Self promotion is welcome in #showandtell as long as it is your own work. Blackformat is a community of real people having real conversation, so we also encourage you to participate outside of self promotion.</p></li>

        <div class="separator"></div>
        <p  class="pSlide-up">Be as involved as you want to be. There are a lot of members in this group. This means some are more vocal than others, and new members or quieter members often feel left out. ‚ÄúLurking‚Äù is a totally valid way to belong, but know that your participation is one hundred percent welcome, anytime.</p>
        <p  class="pSlide-up">People are complex and so are ideas. We‚Äôre a very enthusiastic bunch, and sometimes we just want to share our excitement (or rant) about something without fearing a conflict. Healthy debate is welcome, but please refrain from instigating an argument with someone if they haven‚Äôt expressed their willingness to debate.</p>
        <p  class="pSlide-up">Remain calm and ‚Äädon‚Äôt polarize the discussion. In discussions with multiple conflicting points of view, the goal for all sides should always be information and education, not shutting down people with opposing viewpoints or making them feel bad.</p>
        <p  class="pSlide-up">You are allowed to remove yourself from a situation without feeling pressured to respond. If someone else has recused themselves, respect their decision and don‚Äôt tag them in your comments or pressure them to respond.</p>
